# Guidelines for contribution :pencil:
## Discussion
Although not mandatory, the contributing author could start a conversation in
the corresponding [issue tracker][4] to discuss the intent of potential changes.

## Fork and pull request
All contributions(enhancements or bug fix) are made via [pull request][1]. To
do a pull request, the contributor should [fork][2] the repository under
consideration. Then make the fixes in that repository and submit a [pull
request][1] to the **develop** branch of the original repository. 

## Unit tests
All patches from contributors are expected to pass the prescribed unit tests of
that repository. The contributors could add additional unit tests if necessary.
In case of failing unit tests, contributing authors are expected to update
their pull requests to address the failures until the tests passes and the pull
request merges successfully.

## Review and accpetance
Every pull request will get reviewed by one of [dictyBase][3] developer. If the
patch passes review the developer will accept it with a comment.
